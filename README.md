## WordPress Theme & Files

#### Installation
To set up a local staging version of this site, follow these steps:
*  Download WordPress v4.2.3 and unzip to where you want the site to live.
*  Delete the "wp-content" directoryâ€”we're tracking this so we all share the same plugins and files.
*  In that directory, run `git clone <insert url> .` to clone the branch into the current directory.
